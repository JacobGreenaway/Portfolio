                    <p>The World Cafe process began with everyone creating and presenting initial 'inspiration' ideas.  The aim of this was to look out into the world and dream up something that we would imagine being available in the future.  Throuout this process we were encouraged to look into the realms of sci-fi and fiction, and to really push the boundaries of what we thought was possible with our concepts</p>
                    <p>'Presence' was the concept that I ended up presenting.  It plays with the notion that people always look for an empty bench when they need to sit, avoiding contact with others where possible.  Presence looked to connect people in a playful and unitrusive way, so that sitting at a bench by oneself would not prevent you from being able to interact with others.</p>
